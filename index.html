            <p>Any fan of Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe will enjoy this film.

But if you don’t know anything about Marvel, it might be a hard blockbuster to enjoy. Yes, there’s the typical fight scenes, crashes, battles, drama and everything that comes with a major motion picture. But the nostalgia brought on throughout the film won’t work for those who know nothing about it.

It’s the must-see film of the winter season without question. It will break you, put you back together and break you again. But it’s a film that reminds us of the power of storytelling and the importance of why we see movies — they show us the pitfalls we go through and how we climb our way out of them, like an amazing and friendly heroic spider.</p>

            <p>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings opens in theaters on September 3.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings strikes a tricky balance: reflecting the real-life complicated conflict between first-gen Asian American children and the wishes of their immigrant parents while also serving up the dynamic action scenes that the MCU is known for. Director Destin Daniel Cretton skillfully juggles both of these lofty goals, logging an entry in the Marvel universe that’s both emotionally resonant and delightfully exciting enough to outweigh its occasionally uneven visuals and unfulfilled lore.

Simu Liu makes his mark on the MCU as its latest superhero, Shang-Chi, who’s being targeted by his father Wenwu (an enthralling Tony Leung) and his The Ten Rings, the weapons and secret crime organization. When his father’s vision collides with Shang-Chi’s moral compass, he has to decide to finally take responsibility and stand up to his father, while also attempting to forgive himself for his part in the sins that first tore their family apart. In this, the movie tries to balance a handful of big ideas, some of which deal with issues squarely attuned to the children of immigrants: Whose path do you follow, the one designed for you or the one you make for yourself? How do you grieve unmet expectations in any aspect of your life? It’s an interesting, but obvious, way to frame the hero’s journey for a major superhero film starring actors of Asian descent.

Speaking of our leads, Liu and Awkwafina have easy and genuine chemistry that slyly sells the idea of Shang-Chi (Shaun, to his American friends) and Katy as a capable duo for many adventures to come. The classic immigrant parent question of when will they get real jobs (i.e. grow up) hangs over them throughout the film, but especially with Katy, who is vocal about everyone having a calling except for her.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">One of the main environmental causes of the 1980s was the attempt to prevent the enlargement of the ozone layer hole that protects the planet from harmful UV rays. Activists mobilized street protests and politicians held rallies.

And change is happening, according to one last one examine U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, a global agreement to regulate the depletion of nearly 100 ozone-depleted chemicals, 443 million Americans are likely to be saved from skin cancer by the end of the year. in this century.

The hole in the ozone layer remains huge, roughly North America – but every 10 years it is reviving from one percent to three, According to the UN. The hole in some parts of the northern hemisphere is expected to be completely healed by 2030, and it is expected to be completely repaired in the southern hemisphere and polar regions by 2060. According to UN data.

Global action on the issue through the Montreal Protocol has prevented more than 99 percent of the potential health consequences that would otherwise result from ozone depletion, NCAR reported.

Ecologists hope that the relative success of the ozone layer protection movement could be repeated the fight against climate change; so far, that hasn’t happened.</p>

            <h4>Melting Ice Caps and Sea Level Rise</h4>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.cRgFzbIVuIeNSt4KADsRtgHaE7?w=239&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The climate crisis is warming the Arctic more than twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet. Seas are now rising an average of 3.2 mm per year globally, and are predicted to climb to a total of 0.2 to 2m by 2100. In the Arctic, the Greenland Ice Sheet poses the greatest risk for sea levels because melting land ice is the main cause of rising sea levels.

Representing arguably the biggest of the environmental problems, this is made all the more concerning considering that last year’s summer triggered the loss of 60 billion tons of ice from Greenland, enough to raise global sea levels by 2.2mm in just two months. According to satellite data, the Greenland ice sheet lost a record amount of ice in 2019: an average of a million tons per minute throughout the year, one of the biggest environmental problems that has cascading effects.

If the entire Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level would rise by six metres.

Meanwhile, the Antarctic continent contributes about 1 millimeter per year to sea level rise, which is a third of the annual global increase. 

Additionally, the last fully intact ice shelf in Canada in the Arctic recently collapsed, having lost about 80 sq km, or 40%, of its area over a two-day period in late July, according to the Canadian Ice Service. 

The sea level rise will have a devastating impact on those living in coastal regions: according to research and advocacy group Climate Central, sea level rise this century could flood coastal areas that are now home to 340 million to 480 million people, forcing them to migrate to safer areas and contributing to overpopulation and strain of resources in the areas they migrate to. 

Take Shanghai’s megalopolis for example, which is built around the low-lying Yangtze river delta. As the fourth most populous city in the world, the flood risk in the area is high due to its geographical position. Any flooding caused by a higher rainfall can potentially be catastrophic in relation to evacuation, water management and property damage. </p>
